# Fast and Low Official SDK

This SDK is used to create custom content for the Asymmetric VR game "Fast and Low". 

At the moment, this editor is only used to create/add user-made missions/levels.

This editor is Unity basedâ€¦and requires Unity 2017.4.33f1 (which can be easily found on the Unity website). Using the Unity editor, users can import their own 3d-Assets, and use the tools to set-up things like enemy placements, enemy patrol paths, cover points and etc. Each of these tools will be covered in the documentation.

This repository is still a work in progress and should evolve over time depending of game updates and community involvement.
For more information about the SDK and how to use it, please join the Fast and Low Discord or check the Wiki.
